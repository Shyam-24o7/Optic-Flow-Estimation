"""Closing-speed ratio: does an object close faster than we drive?

With camera rotation removed, a static road pixel's flow points away from the FOE
with magnitude |p - FOE| / TTC per frame. On a flat road depth is proportional to
1 / (y - y_horizon), and when we drive forward the horizon is the FOE's row, so

    C = TTC_road(y) * (y - y_FOE)            [frames * px]

is the same for every road pixel: our speed over the camera height, in image
terms. C is measured where road flow is large and accurate (the band between the
horizon and the hood), then gives the static TTC at any object's contact row:
TTC_static = C / (y_bottom - y_FOE). No calibration, no camera height.

kappa = TTC_static / TTC_object = closing speed / our speed: about 1 for parked
objects, below 1 for traffic going our way, well above 1 for oncoming traffic.
Forward-collision warning targets traffic going our way in our lane (the NHTSA
scenarios), so clearly oncoming objects are never the lead vehicle.
